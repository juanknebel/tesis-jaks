\section{Introduction}
Results for the query "Similar topics in differents venues" were generated for the database 
"Data-Driven Journey through Software Engineering Research".\\
There are five results, each one has a different $\gamma$ (0,1; 0,3; 0,5; 0,7; 0,9). When $\gamma$ 
is closer to 1 the solutions has more cohesion inside the bundles and when it is closer to 0 the 
solution reflects diversity of the answer loosing cohesion inside the bundle.\\
Each result contain ten bundles of five papers with similar topics presented in different venues.
To define what is a similar topic, we present the topic profile as a vector of $n$ dimension, where 
n is the number of topics, then the similarity between two papers is given by the vector angle of 
the two vectors.\\
The original database has more than 8000 papers, but it has refined for papers that dosen't have a 
topic profile.
